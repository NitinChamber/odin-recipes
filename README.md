Project Introduction:

This project is a simple and vibrant website showcasing authentic Indian recipes, built using basic HTML. It's designed to help users explore traditional dishes from various regions of India. Through this project, I practiced core HTML concepts, including:

    - Creating and linking multiple pages

    - Adding and formatting images

    - Using ordered and unordered lists for ingredients and steps

    - Structuring content with headings, paragraphs, and semantic tags

The goal was to combine learning with creativity, resulting in an informative and visually engaging recipe site.
