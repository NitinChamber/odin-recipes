    <h2>Authentic Dal Makhani Recipe - Rich, Creamy, and Full of Flavor</h2>
    
    <p>Dal Makhani is a rich and creamy North Indian lentil dish made primarily with whole black lentils (urad dal) and kidney beans (rajma). Slow-cooked for hours, sometimes overnight, the dish develops a deep, earthy flavor that's elevated with the addition of butter and cream—hence the name “makhani,” meaning "buttery" in Hindi. Traditional recipes involve simmering the lentils with tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and a blend of aromatic spices such as garam masala, cumin, and kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), creating a luxurious and comforting meal.</p>
    
    <p>Dal makhani holds a special place in Punjabi cuisine and is often associated with celebratory meals and special occasions. It pairs perfectly with naan, roti, or steamed basmati rice. Though it's a vegetarian dish, its richness makes it hearty and satisfying, appealing to a wide range of palates. Whether served at a roadside dhaba or in a high-end restaurant, dal makhani is a beloved classic that exemplifies the depth and warmth of Indian comfort food.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Add all the three dal into a large bowl, add water & wash them by rubbing them in between your palms 3-4 times until the water added turns clear, then let the dal soak for 10-12 hours.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once soaked wash the dal again similarly until the added water turns clear, discard that water & add the dal into the cooker.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add garlic, water, salt & kashmiri red chilli powder & pressure cook the dal over high flame for 4 whistles, then switch off the flame & let the cooker depressurize naturally.</p></li>
        <li><p>Further mash the dal lightly using a potato masher, don't mash it too much to make a paste, just mash until the rajma disappears then transfer it into a bowl & set it aside until you make the tempering.</p></li>
        <li><p>Set the same pressure cooker or a stock pot on high flame & add butter along with the oil & let the butter melt.</p></li>
        <li><p>Further add ginger garlic paste, stir & cook over medium flame for 2 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lower the flame & add kashmiri red chilli powder & garam masala, stir well & then add the tomato puree & salt, stir well & cook over high flame until the oil separates & the tomato puree tunrs crumbly.</p></li>
        <li><p>Then add the cooked dal, mix well with the tempering & add hot water as required, the dal should become slightly thin so that it gets time to cook while you let it simmer further, cook the dal for at least 25 minutes until it thickens.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once the dal has thickened after simmering for 25 minutes add fresh cream, roasted kasuri methi powder, garam masala & butter, stir well then taste for salt & adjust accordingly.</p></li>
    </ol>
